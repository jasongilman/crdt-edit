# crdt-edit

An experimental collaborative text editor built on CRDTs. This was built using the Logoot CRDT. See [the Logoot paper](http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/34/59/11/PDF/main.pdf) for more information.

## Usage

### REPL

  * Run `lein repl`
  * Enter `(reset)`
    * This will start two instances of the editor within one repl that will be connected to one another.

### Command Line

  * Build it
    * `lein uberjar`
  * Run it
    * `java -jar target/crdt-edit-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar --port 3000 --site alpha`
  * Enter the hostname and port of another collaborator on the local network or you can start up an additional instance for testing on a different port.
  

## TODOs

  * Nice To haves
    * Use persistent http connections
    * Add text area showing the current logoot document.
